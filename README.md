# Music-Translation-for-and-by-Deaf

The purpose of this program is to assist Deaf and HOH peoples with understanding music. 
This app will allow user to choose a song of their choice.
The main function of the app will be to horizontally scroll through the lyrics with a notation for the user to follow along.
The main function will be at the top of the screen.
Secondary and tertiary options will be available to users to choose from.
Secondary functionality will be a video of a person (AI or real) that is lip singing with the song in an exaggerated manner.
Tertiary functions may include representation of other instrumentation, eg. guitars, piano, trumpets, sax, drums, etc. This representation will preference live video recordings, but may be supplemented with graphic representation similar to the follow-along lyric representation from primary function.
Tertiary functions may also include ASL direct translations, NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH ASL INTERPRETATION NOR SIGNED EXACT ENGLISH (SEE).

# To run the Alpha version of the Music Translator
Access the musictranslator.org website on your web browser, upload a music (.wav) file and corresponding lyrics (.txt) file, add an Alpha access code and submit.
A player-ui will load after your submission is processed. Press play and enjoy!
Alternatively, download this repository, start a Kubernetes cluster, set your own Access Code values in the main.py, and run locally on your own machine.
